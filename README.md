## Introduction

This project attempts to make a system that can parse, cluster and then visualise data. This project also attmepts to support plugins. 

The main program for this project can be found in Final Systems / Extensible Clustering.

## Whats Included

Parsing Files: GMA Series Matrix Parser

Clustering Data: K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Visualising data: Aggomerative Dendrogram -> Supports output from the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm

## Prerequisites

To run the system, you will require java >= 11 installed.

## Running the system

To run the system, please download the .JAR file for your operating system from the downloads section below. 

Then, navigate into the directory you are storing it in, and open it, using ‘java -jar ExtensibleClustering…’ 

These .jar contain the JavaFX dependencies, so these do not need to be installed.
